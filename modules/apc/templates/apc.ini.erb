;  apc.enabled can be set to 0 to disable APC. This is primarily useful when APC
;  is statically compiled into PHP, since there is no other way to disable it
;  (when compiled as a DSO, the extension line in php.ini can just be commented-out).

;  The size of each shared memory segment in MB. By default, some systems (including
;  most BSD variants) have very low limits on the size of a shared memory segment.
apc.shm_size=<%= scope.lookupvar('apc::params::shm_size') %>M

;  The number of seconds a cache entry is allowed to idle in a slot in case this
;  cache entry slot is needed by another entry. Leaving this at zero means that
;  APC's cache could potentially fill up with stale entries while newer entries
;  won't be cached. In the event of a cache running out of available memory, the
;  cache will be completely expunged if ttl is equal to 0. Otherwise, if the ttl
;  is greater than 0, APC will attempt to remove expired entries.
